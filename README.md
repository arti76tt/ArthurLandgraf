- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArthurLandgraf
- 🌎 I'm from Brazil (and currently here), but I've had professional experiences in Europe and Southeast Asia,
- 👀 With 26 y'o in the bag, I'm in a journey to transform my career jumping into Data Science and Programming,
- 🌱 I'm currently learning mostly by myself and with the help of @DataQuest!

Python | SQL | and more soon, hopefully 😅
