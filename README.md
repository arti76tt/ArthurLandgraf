- 👋 Hi, I’m Arthur!
- 🌱 I am a Data Engineer equipped mainly with Python and SQL. I've also done a bunch of DataOps in AWS, GCP setting up and managing Kubernetes, Load Balancers yada yada...
- 📊 My favorite part about working with data is to enable data-oriented business decision that drive true transformation. Data (almost) never lies, it can spit some harsh truth that can't be argued against with fairy tails or daydreams.
- 🌎 I'm from Brazil, and I've had professional experiences in Europe and Southeast Asia, and have been in 20+ countries.
